# SensAI

SensAI is an AI-first Learning Management System (LMS) enabling educators to teach smarter and reach further. SensAI coaches students through questions that develop deeper thinkingâ€”just like you would, but for every student and all the time.

This repository contains both backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (React) code for SensAI.

## Setup

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/08sarthak/Hyperverge-Team-Error.git
   cd Hyperverge-Team-Error/sensai-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment variables**  
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required settings (DB connection, API keys, etc.).

4. **Database setup**  
   - Set up your database as per the environment file.
   - Run migrations if available (see project docs for details).

5. **Run the backend server**  
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend (React/Next.js)

See the `sensai-frontend` directory for complete instructions.  
Basic steps:
1. Ensure backend is running.
2. Install Node.js (if not already).
3. Clone and set up frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../sensai-frontend
   npm ci
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local as needed (Judge0 keys, OAuth, etc.)
   npm run dev
   ```
   App will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

### Backend

- Built with **FastAPI**, the backend serves RESTful endpoints for all core LMS and AI features.
- **Key modules/routes include:**
  - `/auth`: Authentication (sign-in, sign-up, JWT tokens, etc.)
  - `/users`, `/organizations`, `/cohorts`, `/courses`, `/milestones`, `/scorecards`, `/tasks`, `/lessonplan`, `/student`, etc.: User, organization, and educational content management.
  - `/ai` and `/chat`: AI-driven interactions, including question answering, chat coaching, and real-time feedback.
  - `/file`: File upload and download.
  - `/code`: Code execution and evaluation (uses Judge0 or similar).
- **AI Features:**  
  AI chat endpoints use modern language models to analyze student input and provide tailored feedback. The system can route tasks to different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o for general, O3 for reasoning tasks).
- **RAG-Enhanced Lesson Plan Generation**  
  SensAI leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for lesson planning, combining topic-specific retrieval, web resource integration, and iterative review.

- **Middleware:**  
  - CORS enabled for frontend-backend interaction.
  - Bugsnag integration for error monitoring.
- **Testing:**  
  Uses `pytest` for API and logic testing. Run `./run_tests.sh` for full test and coverage report.

### Frontend

- Built with React (Next.js).
- Connects to backend for authentication, course/task management, and AI chat.
- Includes components like `LearningMaterialViewer`, interactive chat, and dashboards.

## ðŸ§  Intelligent Lesson Plan & Assessment Workflows

SensAI supports two tightly integrated, AI-driven flows that power both personalized assessment and RAG-enhanced lesson plan generation.

---

### 1. Personalized Assessment & Lesson Plan Generation

This workflow fetches educational content, runs a conversational assessment using an LLM, processes the results, and generates a lesson plan tailored to the learnerâ€™s needs.

```mermaid
graph TD
    START(["START"])
    fetch_content["fetch_content [fetch_content]\nFetches content from MongoDB based on thread_id"]
    bootstrap["bootstrap [bootstrap]\nInjects system prompt for assessment conversation"]
    assess["assess [call_model]\nHandles conversational assessment with LLM"]
    process_assessment["process_assessment [process_assessment]\nProcesses assessment completion and extracts data"]
    generate_plan["generate_plan [generate_lesson_plan]\nGenerates personalized lesson plan based on assessment"]
    END(["END"])
    START --> fetch_content
    fetch_content --> bootstrap
    fetch_content --> END
    bootstrap --> assess
    assess --> process_assessment
    process_assessment --> END
    process_assessment --> generate_plan
    generate_plan --> END
```

**Node Details:**
- **fetch_content:** Loads educational content from MongoDB for a given thread.
- **bootstrap:** Injects a system prompt to prime the assessment conversation.
- **assess:** Uses an LLM for interactive, conversational assessment with the learner.
- **process_assessment:** Analyzes assessment outcomes and extracts actionable data.
- **generate_plan:** Uses assessment outcomes to create a personalized lesson plan.

### 2. RAG-Enhanced Lesson Plan Generation

This workflow combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for lesson planning with iterative review and revision for high-quality results.

```mermaid
graph TD
    START(["START"])
    prompt["prompt [generate_user_prompt]\nGenerates user prompt with lesson plan parameters"]
    points["points [points_lesson_plan_generator]\nGenerates lesson plan outline in points format"]
    detailed_lesson_plan["detailed_lesson_plan [detailed_lesson_plan_generator]\nGenerates detailed lesson plan content for each lecture"]
    review_lesson_plan["review_lesson_plan [review_lesson_plan_node]\nReviews generated lesson plan for quality and appropriateness"]
    END(["END"])
    START --> prompt
    prompt --> points
    points --> detailed_lesson_plan
    detailed_lesson_plan --> review_lesson_plan
    review_lesson_plan -->|revise| detailed_lesson_plan
    review_lesson_plan -->|approve| END
```

**Node Details:**
- **prompt:** Crafts a comprehensive user prompt using parameters (grade, subject, topic, lectures, etc.)
- **points:** Generates a lesson plan outline using RAG techniques.
- **detailed_lesson_plan:** Produces detailed, lecture-wise lesson content, leveraging retrieved resources.
- **review_lesson_plan:** Reviews the lesson plan for completeness and quality; may trigger revision or approve and finish.

---

### ðŸš€ How These Workflows Empower SensAI

- **Personalized:** Every lesson plan is adapted based on real learner assessment.
- **AI-Augmented:** Conversational LLMs and RAG combine for deep reasoning and rich content generation.
- **Quality-First:** Automated review/revision ensures lesson plans are accurate and effective.
- **Modular:** Each step is a distinct, testable node for easier maintenance and extension.

For more technical details, see the implementation in `app/utils_rag/graph_rag.py` and the assessment modules.

## Testing

**Backend:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
./run_tests.sh
# Coverage report: coverage_html/index.html
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm run test:ci
# (Optional) Upload coverage to Codecov
```
