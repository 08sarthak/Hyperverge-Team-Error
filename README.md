# SensAI

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gl/hvacademy/sensai-ai/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gl/hvacademy/sensai-ai)

SensAI is an AI-first Learning Management System (LMS) which enables educators to teach smarter and reach further. SensAI coaches students through questions that develop deeper thinkingâ€”just like you would, but for every student and all the time.

This repository contains both backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (React) code for SensAI.  
- **Backend**: Handles AI chat, user management, tasks, scoring, and more.
- **Frontend**: User interface for educators and learners.

---

## Setup

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/08sarthak/Hyperverge-Team-Error.git
   cd Hyperverge-Team-Error/sensai-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment variables**  
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required settings (DB connection, API keys, etc.).

4. **Database setup**  
   - Set up your database as per the environment file.
   - Run migrations if available (see project docs for details).

5. **Run the backend server**  
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend (React/Next.js)

See the `sensai-frontend` directory for complete instructions.  
Basic steps:
1. Ensure backend is running.
2. Install Node.js (if not already).
3. Clone and set up frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../sensai-frontend
   npm ci
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local as needed (Judge0 keys, OAuth, etc.)
   npm run dev
   ```
   App will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How it works

### Backend

- Built with **FastAPI**, the backend serves RESTful endpoints for all core LMS and AI features.
- **Key modules/routes include:**
  - `/auth`: Authentication (sign-in, sign-up, JWT tokens, etc.)
  - `/users`, `/organizations`, `/cohorts`, `/courses`, `/milestones`, `/scorecards`, `/tasks`, `/lessonplan`, `/student`, etc.: User, organization, and educational content management.
  - `/ai` and `/chat`: AI-driven interactions, including question answering, chat coaching, and real-time feedback.
  - `/file`: File upload and download.
  - `/code`: Code execution and evaluation (uses Judge0 or similar).
- **AI Features**:  
  AI chat endpoints use modern language models to analyze student input and provide tailored feedback. The system can route tasks to different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o for general, O3 for reasoning tasks).
- **Middleware**:  
  - CORS enabled for frontend-backend interaction.
  - Bugsnag integration for error monitoring.
- **Testing**:  
  Uses `pytest` for API and logic testing. Run `./run_tests.sh` for full test and coverage report.

### Frontend

- Built with React (Next.js).
- Connects to backend for authentication, course/task management, and AI chat.
- Includes components like `LearningMaterialViewer`, interactive chat, and dashboards.

## Testing

**Backend:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
./run_tests.sh
# Coverage report: coverage_html/index.html
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm run test:ci
# (Optional) Upload coverage to Codecov
```
