# SensAI

SensAI is an AI-first Learning Management System (LMS) enabling educators to teach smarter and reach further. SensAI coaches students through questions that develop deeper thinkingâ€”just like you would, but for every student and all the time.

This repository contains both backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (React) code for SensAI.

## Features

- **RAG-Enhanced Lesson Plan Generation:** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware, adaptive lesson plans.
- **Reading Level Estimation:** Automatically estimate student reading levels and tailor content accordingly.
- **Duplicate Detection:** Prevents content overlap using advanced prompting and structured input validation.
- **Structured Inputs:** All flows are designed to operate on well-defined, structured data, minimizing ambiguity.
- **LangGraph Structures:** The core logic is implemented via flexible graph-based workflows, enabling modular and extensible pipelines.
- **Parallel Execution:** Graph nodes can be executed in parallel, drastically reducing execution time for complex processes.

## Setup

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/08sarthak/Hyperverge-Team-Error.git
   cd Hyperverge-Team-Error/sensai-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment variables**  
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required settings (DB connection, API keys, etc.).

4. **Database setup**  
   - Set up your database as per the environment file.
   - Run migrations if available (see project docs for details).

5. **Run the backend server**  
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend (React/Next.js)

See the `sensai-frontend` directory for complete instructions.  
Basic steps:
1. Ensure backend is running.
2. Install Node.js (if not already).
3. Clone and set up frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../sensai-frontend
   npm ci
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local as needed (Judge0 keys, OAuth, etc.)
   npm run dev
   ```
   App will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

SensAI leverages advanced AI workflows, RAG, and graph-based orchestration to deliver individualized learning for every student and intelligent planning tools for educators.

### Educator Journey

Educators can create, review, and refine lesson plans using a variety of intelligent tools:

- `@router.post("/Lesson_Plan")`: Generate a lesson plan from the stored database, deriving study material from CBSE, ICSE, State Board, etc. portals  
  *(Route: see `sensai-ai/src/api/routes/lessonplan.py`)*

- `@router.post("/Lesson_Plan_from_Topic")`: Mainly focused on generating lesson plans from the study material provided by the educator, using RAG to transcribe the material and generate the lesson plan

- `@router.post("/Lesson_Plan_auto")`: (Future scope) A unified API that merges the above, simplifying and automating lesson planning.

- `@router.post("/review_lesson_plan")`: Automatically reviews generated lesson plans and triggers revisions if they do not meet quality, coverage, or personalization criteria.

### Student Journey

Students are guided through a two-part, adaptive assessment that culminates in a fully personalized lesson plan:

- `@router.post("/assessment")`:  
  Students provide basic info (class, board, subject, chapter number, etc.), which is stored in a unique thread per student.  
  *(Route: see `sensai-ai/src/api/routes/student.py`)*

- `@router.post("/assessment/continue")`:  
  The system continues the thread with 2â€“3 behavioral questions to understand learning styles, habits, and routines, followed by 10 chapter-specific questions to assess current understanding.
  Using these behavioral and academic insights, SensAI generates an optimal, individualized learning plan for each student.

## ðŸ§  Intelligent Lesson Plan & Assessment Workflows

SensAI supports two tightly integrated, AI-driven flows that power both personalized assessment and RAG-enhanced lesson plan generation.

### 1. Learner's Journey Graph

This workflow fetches educational content, conducts a conversational assessment using an LLM, processes the results, and generates a lesson plan precisely tailored to the learnerâ€™s needs.

```mermaid
graph TD
    START(["START"])
    fetch_content["fetch_content [fetch_content]\nFetches content from MongoDB based on thread_id"]
    bootstrap["bootstrap [bootstrap]\nInjects system prompt for assessment conversation"]
    assess["assess [call_model]\nHandles conversational assessment with LLM"]
    process_assessment["process_assessment [process_assessment]\nProcesses assessment completion and extracts data"]
    generate_plan["generate_plan [generate_lesson_plan]\nGenerates personalized lesson plan based on assessment"]
    END(["END"])
    START --> fetch_content
    fetch_content --> bootstrap
    fetch_content --> END
    bootstrap --> assess
    assess --> process_assessment
    process_assessment --> END
    process_assessment --> generate_plan
    generate_plan --> END
```

**Node Details:**
- **fetch_content:** Loads educational content for the relevant thread.
- **bootstrap:** Injects the system prompt for assessment.
- **assess:** Conducts interactive, conversational assessment using LLM.
- **process_assessment:** Extracts actionable data and finalizes completion.
- **generate_plan:** Produces a personalized lesson plan based on all assessment results.

### 2. Educator's Journey Graph

This workflow utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for lesson planning, with quality checks and revisions for optimal results.

```mermaid
graph TD
    START(["START"])
    prompt["prompt [generate_user_prompt]\nGenerates user prompt with lesson plan parameters"]
    points["points [points_lesson_plan_generator]\nGenerates lesson plan outline in points format"]
    detailed_lesson_plan["detailed_lesson_plan [detailed_lesson_plan_generator]\nGenerates detailed lesson plan content for each lecture"]
    review_lesson_plan["review_lesson_plan [review_lesson_plan_node]\nReviews generated lesson plan for quality and appropriateness"]
    END(["END"])
    START --> prompt
    prompt --> points
    points --> detailed_lesson_plan
    detailed_lesson_plan --> review_lesson_plan
    review_lesson_plan -->|revise| detailed_lesson_plan
    review_lesson_plan -->|approve| END
```

**Node Details:**
- **prompt:** Builds a detailed and structured prompt from all lesson parameters.
- **points:** Generates a lesson outline with RAG techniques.
- **detailed_lesson_plan:** Expands outline to detailed, lecture-wise content.
- **review_lesson_plan:** Reviews the output for accuracy, relevance, and quality, and triggers revision if needed.

### ðŸš€ Why SensAI's Approach is Unique

- **Truly Personalized:** Every plan is based on a blend of behavioral and academic data.
- **AI-Augmented:** Sophisticated prompting, reading level estimation, and duplicate detection are seamlessly integrated.
- **Flexible & Extensible:** Graph-based architecture (LangGraph) makes it easy to extend, customize, or parallelize steps for faster execution.
- **Quality Assurance:** Automated review and revision cycles ensure every lesson plan meets rigorous standards.
