SensAI Architectural Design Brief (Backend & AI Workflows)

Overview:
SensAI is an AI-driven Learning Management System (LMS) designed to personalize learning experiences for students and empower educators with intelligent planning tools. The architecture harmonizes modern backend practices with advanced AI-driven workflows, ensuring modularity, scalability, and adaptability for evolving educational needs.

Key Objectives:
- Deliver personalized, standards-aligned lesson plans using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLMs.
- Conduct adaptive student assessments that inform individualized instruction.
- Enable modular, parallel, and extensible workflow orchestration.
- Maintain robust validation, review, and traceability for all generated educational content.

Core Architectural Components:

1. **Backend Platform**
   - Built on Python FastAPI, chosen for async support, high throughput, and strong API typing.
   - Modular route organization: clear separation between student, educator, and AI/lessonplan endpoints.
   - MongoDB used for flexible storage of content (e.g., chapters, topics), assessment data, and plan artifacts.

2. **AI & Orchestration Layer**
   - Uses GPT-4o and similar LLMs for all generative and analysis tasks: lesson plan outlining, detailed expansion, student assessment, and automated review.
   - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines combine semantic/document retrieval with LLM synthesis to ground outputs in user-supplied or curated content.
   - LangGraph is employed to model workflows as directed graphs, where each node represents a discrete step (e.g., content fetch, prompt build, LLM call, review).
   - Independent nodes are parallelized to minimize latency, supporting future scaling and complex compositions.

3. **Personalization Engine**
   - Student assessment agent interacts via chat to gather academic background, learning style, confidence, habits, and preferences.
   - Assessment results directly parameterize lesson plan generation—adapting objectives, instructional methods, content sequence, and difficulty.
   - Reading level estimation, duplicate detection, and learning style adaptation are handled by specialized prompts and post-processing.

4. **Data & Process Management**
   - Each user interaction (assessment, plan, review) is tracked as a thread; all states and outputs are persisted for history, auditing, and debugging.
   - AI outputs are validated for schema compliance and correctness before being served to users.
   - Versioning of generated plans and reviews ensures traceability and reproducibility.

5. **Quality Assurance Pipeline**
   - Automated LLM-based review agent assesses lesson plans for:
     - Reading level appropriateness, clarity, bias, completeness, compliance (NEP 2020/NCF 2023/SQAAF), and engagement.
   - Plans failing review trigger automated revision cycles, returning to educators only when quality criteria are met.

6. **Extensibility & Maintenance**
   - Each workflow node is a well-defined function, facilitating targeted testing, easy updates, and plug-and-play extension (e.g., adding quiz generation or new compliance standards).
   - Prompt templates are versioned and centrally logged for monitoring and future tuning.
   - The system is designed to integrate emerging LLMs or retrieval mechanisms with minimal refactoring.

Summary:
SensAI’s backend and AI architecture melds graph-based workflow orchestration, robust data management, and advanced LLM integration to deliver a scalable, maintainable, and highly personalized LMS. The architecture is positioned for rapid extension as education and AI technology evolve, while keeping educator and student needs central.
